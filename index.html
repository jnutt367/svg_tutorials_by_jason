                    <h1>John the Baptist’s Testimony</h1>

                    <p>This is John’s testimony when the Jews from Jerusalem sent priests and Levites to ask him, “Who are you?”
                    </p>
                    <p>He did not refuse to answer, but he declared: “I am not the Messiah.”</p>

                    <p>“What then?” they asked him. “Are you Elijah?”</p>

                    <p>“I am not,” he said.</p>

                    <p>“Are you the Prophet?”</p>

                    <p>“No,” he answered.</p>

                    <p>“Who are you, then?” they asked. “We need to give an answer to those who sent us. What can you tell us about yourself?”</p>

                    <p>He said, “I am a voice of one crying out in the wilderness: Make straight the way of the Lord—just as Isaiah the prophet said.”</p>

                    <p>Now they had been sent from the Pharisees. So they asked him, “Why then do you baptize if you aren’t the Messiah, or Elijah, or the Prophet?”</p>

                    <p>“I baptize with water,” John answered them. “Someone stands among you, but you don’t know Him. He is the One coming after me, whose sandal strap I’m not worthy to untie.”</p>

                    <p>All this happened in Bethany across the Jordan, where John was baptizing.</p>
