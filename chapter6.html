                    <p>After this, Jesus crossed the Sea of Galilee (or Tiberias).</p>
                    <p> 2 And a huge crowd was following Him because they saw the signs that He was performing by healing the sick.</p>
                    <p>3 So Jesus went up a mountain and sat down there with His disciples.</p>
                    <p>4 Now the Passover, a Jewish festival, was near.</p>
                    <p>5 Therefore, when Jesus looked up and noticed a huge crowd coming toward Him, He asked Philip, </p>
                    <p>“Where will we buy bread so these people can eat?”</p>
                    <p>6 He asked this to test him, for He Himself knew what He was going to do. 7 Philip answered, “Two hundred denarii worth of bread wouldn’t be enough for each of them to have a little.”</p>

                    <p>9 “There’s a boy here who has five barley loaves and two fish—but what are they for so many?”</p>
                    <p>10 Then Jesus said, “Have the people sit down.” There was plenty of grass in that place,</p>
                    <p>so they sat down. The men numbered about 5,000. </p>
                    <p>11 Then Jesus took the loaves, and after giving thanks He distributed them to those who were seated—so also with the fish, as much as they wanted.</p>
                    <p>12 When they were full, He told His disciples, “Collect the leftovers so that nothing is wasted.” </p>
                    <p>13 So they collected them and filled 12 baskets with the pieces from the five barley loaves that were left over by those who had eaten.</p>

                        again[b] to the mountain by Himself. The Fifth Sign: Walking on Water 16 When evening came, His disciples went down to the sea, 17 got into a boat, and started across the sea to Capernaum. Darkness had already set in, but Jesus
                        had not yet come to them. 18 Then a high wind arose, and the sea began to churn. 19 After they had rowed about three or four miles,[c] they saw Jesus walking on the sea. He was coming near the boat, and they were afraid. 20 But
                        He said to them, “It is I.[d] Don’t be afraid!” 21 Then they were willing to take Him on board, and at once the boat was at the shore where they were heading.

                    <p>22 The next day, the crowd that had stayed on the other side of the sea knew there had been only one boat.</p>
                    <p>They also knew that Jesus had not boarded the boat with His disciples, but that His disciples had gone off alone.</p>
                    <p>23 Some boats from Tiberias came near the place where they ate the bread after the Lord gave thanks.</p>
                    <p>24 When the crowd saw that neither Jesus nor His disciples were there, they got into the boats and went to Capernaum looking for Jesus.</p>
                    <p> 25 When they found Him on the other side of the sea, they said to Him, “Rabbi, when did You get here?” </p>

                    <p>26 Jesus answered, “I assure you: You are looking for Me, not because you saw the signs, but because you ate the loaves and were filled.</p>

                    <p>27 Don’t work for the food that perishes but for the food that lasts for eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you, because God the Father has set His seal of approval on Him.”</p>
                    <p>28 “What can we do to perform the works of God?” they asked.</p>

                    <p> 30 “What sign then are You going to do so we may see and believe You?” they asked. </p>
                    <p>“What are You going to perform? 31 Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, just as it is written: He gave them bread from heaven to eat.”</p>
                    <p>32 Jesus said to them, “I assure you: Moses didn’t give you the bread from heaven, but My Father gives you the real bread from heaven.</p>
                    <p>33 For the bread of God is the One who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.” </p>

                    <p>will ever be thirsty again. 36 But as I told you, you’ve seen Me, and yet you do not believe.</p>

                    <p>41 Therefore the Jews started complaining about Him because He said, “I am the bread that came down from heaven.” 42 They were saying, “Isn’t this Jesus the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How can He now say, ‘I have
                        come down from heaven’?”
                    </p>
                    <p>43 Jesus answered them, “Stop complaining among yourselves. 44 No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws[j] him, and I will raise him up on the last day. 45 It is written in the Prophets: And they will all be taught
                        by God.</p>

                    <p>48 I am the bread of life. 49 Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died. 50 This is the bread that comes down from heaven so that anyone may eat of it and not die.</p>
                    <p>51 I am the living bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread he will live forever. The bread that I will give for the life of the world is My flesh.”</p>

                    <p>52 At that, the Jews argued among themselves, “How can this man give us His flesh to eat?” </p>
                    <p>53 So Jesus said to them, “I assure you: Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you do not have life in yourselves.</p>
                    <p>54 Anyone who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day,</p>

                    <p>57 Just as the living Father sent Me and I live because of the Father, so the one who feeds on Me will live because of Me.</p>

                    <p>Many Disciples Desert Jesus 60 Therefore, when many of His disciples heard this, they said,</p>
                    <p>“This teaching is hard! Who can accept it?” </p>
                    <p>61 Jesus, knowing in Himself that His disciples were complaining about this, asked them, “Does this offend you?</p>

                    <p>62 Then what if you were to observe the Son of Man ascending to where He was before? 63 The Spirit is the One who gives life.</p>
                    <p>The flesh doesn’t help at all. </p>
                    <p>The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.</p>
                    <p> 64 But there are some among you who don’t believe.”</p>
                    <p>(For Jesus knew from the beginning those who would not believe and the one who would betray Him.)</p>
                    <p>65 He said, “This is why I told you that no one can come to Me unless it is granted to him by the Father.”</p>
                    <p>66 From that moment many of His disciples turned back and no longer accompanied Him. </p>
                    <p>67 Therefore Jesus said to the Twelve, “You don’t want to go away too, do you?”</p>
                    <p>68 Simon Peter answered, “Lord, who will we go to?</p>

                    <p>You have the words of eternal life. </p>
                    <p>69 We have come to believe and know that You are the Holy One of God!”</p>
                    <p>70 Jesus replied to them, “Didn’t I choose you, the Twelve? </p>
                    <p>Yet one of you is the Devil!”</p>
                    <p>71 He was referring to Judas, Simon Iscariot’s son, one of the Twelve, because he was going to betray Him.</p>
