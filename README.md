# This is simply me , writing out the word of God.
## I am reading through my bible and writing it out and publishing in order to share my hope in Jesus Christ who saved me from certain death and hopelessness.
## Today I stand able, hopeful and courageous, in the face of a future that I have no idea where I am heading except that I know HE is indeed leading my steps and paving my way. 
## Not many years ago, I was a hopeless drunk, a person who dreaded living in the life that he himself had destroyed and allowed to become desolate.
# Today...That same man is writing a digital rendering of the true word of the Loerd that was from the beginning of well, EVERYTHING. That is why I have faith
# And that is why I will not quit or become weary in well doing. 
## God bless and keep you all.
