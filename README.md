# SVG Animation Tutorials, for hospitality industry professionals by Jason Nutt. 
## Using animation timelines and simple (free & already drawn for us) SVGs, we can tell a story and make animated short films that entertain our friends and even be used to market whatever you want (Let's say Your brand!)
# Welcome everybody. Waiters, servers, bartenders, managers 
## ....lend me your creative minds and I will show you some really cool and beneficial skills you can use for all sorts of life changing things.
## All that is needed to start following is to download VSCode (it's totally free) or other text editor on your local computer. The one that you are reading this on. 
## After that you will want to create a folder on the same computer and name it something that you will remember in five seconds and everytime you want to work on this project.
## The Next thing will be to go to UnDraw.co
## Here is where we will be picking our SVGs that we want to get moving in this tutorial. Any will do but we will be doing restaurant themes for obvious reasons. Please feel free to comment on what content you would like to see animated, in order to best serve those of you who want to learn from this content. I love to do Christmas stuff soooo...feel free to say you like Halloween and that's what I'll show you. I'm here for you!
